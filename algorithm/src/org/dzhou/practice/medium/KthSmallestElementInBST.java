/**
 * Given a binary search tree, write a function kthSmallest to find the kth
 * smallest element in it.
 * 
 * Note:<br>
 * You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ BST's total elements.
 * 
 * Follow up:<br>
 * What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to
 * find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest
 * routine?
 * 
 * Hint:<br>
 * Try to utilize the property of a BST.<br>
 * What if you could modify the BST node's structure?<br>
 * The optimal runtime complexity is O(height of BST).<br>
