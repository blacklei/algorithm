 *         You are implementing a binary search tree class from scratch, which,
 *         in addition to insert, find and delete, has a method getRandomNode()
 *         which returns a random node from the tree. All nodes should be
 *         equally likely to be chosen. Design and implement an algorithm for
 *         getRandomNode, and explain how you would implement the rest of the
 *         methods.
