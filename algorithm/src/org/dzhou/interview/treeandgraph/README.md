# Tree and Graph

Basic objects: 

- V: vertices, nodes
- E: edges, arcs, links

Size of graph: 

- V + E

What's the maximum number of edges in a directed graph with n vertices?

- n * (n - 1)

What's the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph with n vertices?

- n * (n - 1)/2

Adjacent matrix:

- index of rows or columns represent nodes.
- data in rows or columns represent edges.

Degree:

- In-degree: the in-degree of a vertex, v, is the number of edges with v as their end point.
- Out-degree: the out-degree of a vertex, v, is the number of edges with v as their start point.
- Degree: the degree of a vertex is the sum of its in-degree and its out-degree.

**Matrix multiplication for finding n hop neighbors**

Distance: the distance between two vertices in a graph is the shortest length of a path between them.
