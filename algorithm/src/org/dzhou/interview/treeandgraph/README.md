# Tree and Graph

Basic objects: 

- V: vertices, nodes
- E: edges, arcs, links

Size of graph: 

- V + E

What's the maximum number of edges in a directed graph with n vertices?

- n * (n - 1)

What's the maximum number of edges in an undirected graph with n vertices?

- n * (n - 1)/2

Adjacent matrix:

- index of rows or columns represent nodes.
- data in rows or columns represent edges.

**Matrix multiplication for finding n hop neighbors**
