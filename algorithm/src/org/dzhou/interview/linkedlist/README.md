# Linked List

Remember recursive algorithm take at least O(n) space, where n is the depth of the recursive call. All recursive algorithm can be implemented iteratively, although they may be much more complex.

#### Use Node Implement Linked List

Two elements:

1. data in node.
2. reference of next node.

Method:

1. appendToTail
2. delete

#### Remove duplicates

1. use hash table
2. two iterators

#### kth to last
