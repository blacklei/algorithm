 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts or
 * repeated characters. For example, the string aabbcccccaaa would become
 * a2b2c5a3. If the "compressed" string would not become smaller than the
 * original string, your method should return the original string. You can
 * assume the string has only upper case and lower case letters (a-z).
