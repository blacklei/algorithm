How would you find the kth smallest element in an array of integers?

1. Ask quesion
    - Is it an pre-ordered array
2. Solution:
    1. Selection sort (Find first or second) O(log(n))
    2. Use sort algorithm to sort it first O(log(n))
    3. Use Heap (Create K-size max-heap) O(log(k))
        + can use PriorityQueue use heap in java
    4. Use kind of half of quick sort
